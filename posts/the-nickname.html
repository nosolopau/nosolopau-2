    <h3>/nosolopˈaʊ/</h3>
    <p>This is my venerable nickname, which I created when nobody in the Internet used their real names, like 200 years ago. 
        It comes from the Spanish "no solo Pau", literally "not only Pau", which it was just a dad joke related 
        to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0375400/" target="_blank">Nosolomúsica</a>, a pretty popular Spanish TV show 
        about music and altenative culture from the 2000's, hosted by an American.</p>
    <p>Pau is the Catalan version of my name, Pablo. I lived in Barcelona for more than 7 years so I adopted it, but I prefer just Pablo.
        It's kind of amazing that I formed my nickname after a Spanish show with an American hostess, and my own name in another language, 
        and all that many years before knowing I would eventually end up in the US, struggling to explain such a weird name.</p>
    <p>Now you know the important stuff.</p>
